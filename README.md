# TreeBugger

**TreeBugger** is a React component tree visualizer and inspector. It helps developers understand and debug their component hierarchy with a focus on clarity, usability, and future architectural planning.

This project started as a live visual debugging tool and is evolving into a full-featured system for planning and documenting frontend components from mockup to implementation.

---

## Current Features

- Visual rendering of a mock React component tree
- Recursive component node display with expand/collapse
- Click-to-inspect view showing props and state
- Clear selection highlighting and layout separation

---

## Planned Features

- Visual indication of re-renders
- Snapshot mode for capturing tree states over time
- Compare expected vs actual component structures
- Export props and component definitions for scaffolding tests
- GitHub and Storybook integration (planned for Pro version)
- Planning Mode: manual tree-building from mockups with prop definitions

---

## Technology

- React, Vite, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript.

---

## Philosophy

Frontend architecture should be visual, explainable, and shareable.  
TreeBugger aims to bridge the gap between debugging tools and architectural planning â€” helping developers not only understand how their apps are structured, but how they *could* be structured.
